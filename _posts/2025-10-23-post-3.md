This is part of a series on visualizing personal data to gain more understanding of our lives and behavior.

To explore more personal data, I got access to 4 years of my data from Uber to see what I could learn from analyzing and visualizing it.



My usage before the pandemic was significant. It was my daily commute and often used it while traveling for work outside my home city. After the pandemic set in, and my work turned remote, my uber usage has consequently become rather scanty.

I would not have guessed that my annual expenditure on cabs would amount to ~USD$1500. Feel pretty good about having bought a car now.
